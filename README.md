Part 1 of 3
Building the Home Town App

1) Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.
2) Adjust CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column. Use relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any viewport width.
3) Make sure your touch targets are easy to hit.
4) Test your site across different viewports. Try it on different phones, tablets, and desktops!

Part 2 of 3
1) Pick a set of breakpoints and use one of the patterns that you learned to style the page so that it works across different devices.
2) Test on multiple phones, tablets and browser window sizes and adjust breakpoints.

Add hamburger icon frome the unicode-table.com/en/2630 or fontawesome.
